            <p>
                Although I have taken an alternative path in life, I am a self-starter who thrives on continuous learning. 
                I have recently graduated from Thinkful’s Bootcamp where I studied a plethora of full-stack skills including things like Javascript, node, express, and react. 
                I am also teaching myself the basics of Python and PHP in my free time.
            </p>
            <p>
                While my most recent position was as a sales and customer service manager, I thrive on working on projects that require the ability to focus on details—the kind of work that others may consider tedious. 
                I am a musician turned graphic designer who has an incredibly strong drive to learn and grow, and my next step on that journey is in the coding/engineering/development world. 
                As a musician, I am trained to focus on minute details while also being able to see the context of the big picture.

                A full-stack app built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL API. 
                A user can create, update, delete, and seat reservations for a fictional restaurant.

            <p>
                A react app that I built because I love Formula 1 and I wanted to have a dashboard for all of the info that I constantly look up. 
                The app takes data from an F1 API, has up-to-date drivers and constructors championship standings, upcoming races, and qualifying 
                and race results—which are behind buttons so there are no accidental spoilers. 
                You can even choose your favorite driver to display at the top of the app!

            <p>
                A simple HTML and CSS website that randomly selects a course from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (including DLC courses). 
                I built this app because I wanted an option to select a course randomly to play in time trials, which has no random course option in-game.
